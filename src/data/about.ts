      "I kept running into the same problem. Every time I needed to convert an image, merge a PDF, or format some JSON, I'd land on a website that was slow, covered in ads, and often asked me to sign up before I could do anything.",
      "Worse, I had no idea what was happening to my files. Some tools uploaded them to a server, some added watermarks, and many of them felt like they existed only to serve ads — not to actually help.",
      "So I decided to build the tool site I always wanted. Everything runs locally in your browser. No accounts. No uploads. No watermarks. No annoying interstitials. Just useful tools that work — fast, on any device, for free.",
